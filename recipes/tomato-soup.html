        <ul>
            <li>4 Cups chopped fresh tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 Cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>4 Cloves garlic</li>    
            <li>1 Large slice of onion</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 Teaspoons white sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>How to make</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the tomatoes, chicken broth, garlic and a large slice of onion in the stockpot over a medium heat. Bring it to a boil and allow to simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and run the simmered mixture through a blender. Once blended move the mixture to a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter over a medium heat in the empty stock pot. Stir in the flour to make a roux by cooking and whisking constantly until the mixture turns medium brown.</li>
            <li>Gradually pour in the tomato mixture and whisk as you go to prevent lumps forming. Then stir in the rest.</li>
            <li>Season with sugar and salt to taste.</li>
            <li>If it has cooled down, warm it back up in a pan and serve it hot.</li>
        </ol>
